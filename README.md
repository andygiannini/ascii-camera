You Are What You Say
============

You Are What You Say uses your speech to create an ASCII art video of you.

Once the video begins to render, start talking to it. Try it out [here](https://asciicam.surge.sh)!

Idea by [Collin](https://github.com/collinjoyce).

## Permissions

Requires access to your browser's microphone and camera.

## Supported browsers
